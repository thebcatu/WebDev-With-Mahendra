# Day 11 - Flexbox Landing Page Task

This task demonstrates how to create a responsive landing page using **HTML** and **CSS Flexbox**. Below are the key elements and concepts used in this project:

## Key Features and Steps:
1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Used `<div>` elements to create a two-column layout.
   - Included a `<form>` with fields like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and `<button>` for the "Contact Us" section.
   - Added a showcase section with multiple `<div>` cards to demonstrate styling techniques.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Applied **Flexbox** for layout management (`display: flex;`).
   - Used **linear gradients** for backgrounds (e.g., `background: linear-gradient(...)`).
   - Styled form elements with focus effects (`:focus` pseudo-class).
   - Added hover effects for buttons and cards (`:hover` pseudo-class).

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensured the layout adapts to different screen sizes using flexible widths and heights.

4. **Special Effects**:
   - Used **box shadows** and **borders** for card styling.
   - Added **text shadow** for headings and special text.
   - Included **hover animations** for interactive elements like buttons and list items.

## CSS Concepts for Beginners:
Here are the main CSS concepts used in this project, explained in a beginner-friendly way:

1. **Flexbox**:
   - Flexbox is a layout model that makes it easy to align and distribute space among items in a container.
   - Example: `display: flex;`, `justify-content: space-between;`, `align-items: center;`.

2. **Gradients**:
   - Gradients are smooth transitions between two or more colors.
   - Example: `background: linear-gradient(90deg, #4a90e2, #357abd);`.

3. **Box Shadows**:
   - Box shadows add depth to elements by creating a shadow effect.
   - Example: `box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);`.

4. **Hover Effects**:
   - Hover effects make elements interactive when the user hovers over them.
   - Example: `button:hover { background-color: #357abd; }`.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use flexible units like percentages or `flex` to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## How It Works:
- The **left column** contains a contact form styled with gradients and shadows.
- The **right column** showcases cards with various styling techniques, including typography, lists, and buttons.
