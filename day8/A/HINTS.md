# Admin Panel User List Hints

## Table Structure
- Create a consistent table structure with appropriate headings
- Use `<thead>` and `<tbody>` to organize table content
- Apply `width: 100%` and `border-collapse: collapse` for clean table layout
- Use alternating background colors for better row distinction
- Include proper spacing with `padding` for better readability

## User Interface Elements
- Create action buttons with consistent styling and clear visual hierarchy
- Use descriptive class names like `.edit`, `.delete`, and `.save` for different actions
- Apply appropriate colors to differentiate between action types (green for edit, red for delete)
- Use `cursor: pointer` to indicate clickable elements
- Include appropriate padding and spacing for comfortable user interaction

## Form Integration
- Embed forms within table cells for immediate data manipulation
- Use hidden inputs to carry important data (`<input type="hidden">`)
- Set `display: inline` on forms to maintain consistent layout
- Use appropriate form methods and actions for data submission
- Include visual feedback for form interactions

## Image Handling
- Apply consistent image styling with `.user-img` class
- Use `border-radius: 50%` for circular user avatars
- Set explicit dimensions with appropriate `height` and `width` values
- Include descriptive `alt` text for accessibility
- Use `object-fit: cover` to maintain aspect ratio

## Text Formatting
- Apply appropriate text styles for different content types
- Use `<del>` or `<strike>` tags for deleted or deprecated information
- Style text consistently with appropriate colors and font weights
- Apply `text-align` properties for proper content alignment
